The Gaming Room client is a gaming company looking to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, which was initially developed for Android devices. Their goal was to create a web based version of the game that could be accessible across multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. The core software requirement was to design a scalable, secure, and unified gaming experience where multiple teams could compete in real-time, with a central server managing instances of the game and ensuring efficient handling of game data and images. The client needed a solution that would support future growth and maintain consistency across different operating systems.

In developing the design documentation, the aspect done particularly well was the thorough analysis of the constraints and the architectural recommendations. The document successfully compared different computing platforms and evaluated their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the project's specific needs, such as the requirement for cross-platform compatibility. This comprehensive evaluation provided a clear and justified roadmap for the client, outlining the most suitable environment for development and the reasoning behind each technical decision, which is crucial for both client understanding and developer guidance.

The process of working through the design document was immensely helpful when considering the transition to actual code development. Creating detailed UML diagrams, such as the class diagram, forced a deep engagement with the system's structure, object relationships, and data flow long before a single line of code was written. This upfront planning helped to identify potential logical inconsistencies and architectural challenges, making the subsequent coding phase more efficient and less prone to major restructuring. It served as a blueprint that the entire development team could follow, ensuring everyone had a shared understanding of the system's design.

If one part of the work on the document could be revised, it would be the security section. While the foundational security concepts were addressed, the document could have provided a more detailed threat model and a deeper dive into specific mitigation strategies for a web based application, such as detailed plans for protecting against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross site scripting. To improve it, I would incorporate a dedicated section for a structured threat analysis, perhaps using a framework like STRIDE, to systematically identify and document security threats and their countermeasures in greater detail.

Interpreting the user's needs was central to the software design. The client's need for a cross platform, scalable, and consistent user experience was directly translated into the recommendation of a client-server model with a web-based interface. This approach ensures that any user on a major operating system can access the game through a browser without needing platform specific versions. Considering the user's needs is paramount because the ultimate success of the software depends on its adoption and satisfaction. A design that is technically sound but fails to address the user's core requirements—such as accessibility, performance, and ease of use—will not be successful in the market.

The approach to designing the software was methodical and requirements driven. The strategy began with a thorough analysis of the client's stated needs and constraints, followed by research into the appropriate technologies and architectures that could meet those needs. Techniques like creating UML diagrams were essential for visualizing the system's structure. For future projects, I would continue to employ this strategy of starting with a comprehensive design document. I would also incorporate more iterative feedback loops with the client during the design phase, using techniques like prototyping or wireframing for the user interface, to validate design choices and ensure the final product aligns even more closely with user expectations before significant development resources are committed.
